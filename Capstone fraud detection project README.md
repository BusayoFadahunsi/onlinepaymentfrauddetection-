ML projects

--project description--
The project involves detecting fraud using machine learning models.

--steps--
I used a random sampling method to get a defined number of sample data, as original data set was over a million rows.
Different analysis was done, from univariate to multivariate analysis to gain more insights on the dataset.
One-hot encoding as a form of feature engineering was used on categorical data, to prepare our dataset for modeling.
The models used are, logistic regression, Kmeans classifier, decision tree classifier and random forest classifier.
The Logistic regression model produced the best prediction.
listed my observations from the model preductions.

--challenge--
Had few features and categorical data to work with, so carrying an EDA was a bit tricky.
